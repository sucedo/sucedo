##8 Tips for Oxbridge Interviews

1. Review your potential tutors' area(s) of expertise, in advance of interview; knowledge of, and interest in, those are key to showing dedication.</li>
2. Read your application in detail. Ask your teachers, friends, and others what key points leap out for questioning.</li>
3. Pick 3 key reasons for why you chose the course and college and ensure you can explain these well.</li>
4. Know, in detail, the how the Oxbridge course differs from those of competing universities.</li>
5. Be clear on the key areas and subject options that interest you academically about the Oxbridge course (but be open to alternatives).</li>
6. Speak to current or recent students at your chosen college, course and university, to help determine key areas to focus on.</li>
7. If possible, visit the college and faculty in advance to become familiar and relaxed in this environment; at least arrive at interview with enough time to relax and prepare.</li>
8. Practice as many real time, full-length interviews as you can. These can be with friends, acquaintances, teachers, or a coaching service like Sucedo.</li>
