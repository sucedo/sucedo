##The UK Clinical Aptitude Test

The United Kingdom Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT) is an entrance test that is increasingly being used in the selection process by a number of UK Dental and Medical schools, having been first introduced in the 2006 admissions cycle. The UKCAT’s use is expected to grow over the coming years in the United Kingdom.

UKCAT is a pragmatic test, focusing on assessing candidates’ respective intellects as well as their attitudes and values (in order to determine professional behaviour and suitability for their respective professions). The time allowed in total is 2 hours.

Revising for the test is difficult since it is designed to probe innate skills, including mathematical ability, comprehension, reading and writing, values and social attitudes. Genuine answers are required; indeed, the test cross-checks whether candidates’ answers are genuine.

There are no specific past papers; specimen questions are however available on the <a href="http://www.ukcat.ac.uk/pages/details.aspx?page=preparationOverview" title="UKCAT Specimen Questions">UKCAT website</a>. Certain universities do not weight the UKCAT as much as others.
