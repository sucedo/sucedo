##The National Admissions Test for Law

The National Admissions Test for Law (LNAT) is a university entrance test, used by some law schools to determine admissions based on candidates’ aptitude. LNAT has been used in the United Kingdom by 8 universities since 2004 as a response to intense competition and high A-Level grades between candidates. Since this time 3 further universities have adopted the test.

Candidates have 2 hours in total to complete the LNAT - both an essay and 30 multiple-choice questions; the assessment is on candidates ability to review and comprehend data and the ability to reason logically.

The LNAT is marked out of 24. The average score for the reading component is approximately 13 out of 24. The average score for the multiple-choice element is around 17 out of 30.

To an extent the LNAT mirrors the American Law School Admissions Test (LSAT).

###Content Summary

There are 2 sections to the LNAT:

* Section A - Multiple Choice Questions
  Candidates read 10 passages, answering 30 multiple-choice questions in 80 minutes. Typically, there are between 2 and 5 questions on each passage, which seek to explore arguments in and inference from the respective short passages.
* Section B – Essay Question
  Candidates answer 1 essay question from a choice of 5 questions. The recommended limit is 650 to 700 words; questions are typically open, allowing a student to construct a reasoned argument and, as above, argue logically. The time allowed is 40 minutes.
