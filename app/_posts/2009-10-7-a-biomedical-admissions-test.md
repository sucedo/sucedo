The Biomedical Admissions Test (BMAT) is an entrance test that examines aptitude for certain medical, biomedical, physiological sciences, and veterinary courses. It is the successor to the former Oxford OMAT and Cambridge MVAT assessments. Over the last 4 years in particular, the use of the BMAT has expanded significantly; this is expected to continue.

There are 3 sections to the BMAT. Section 1 and 2 are marked out of 9, whereas section 3 is marked out of 15. Results of the BMAT are weighted so that scores form a normal distribution curve.

The use of the BMAT varies from institution to institution. Certain institutions require a pre-determined score (typically over 19) to invite candidates to interview and exclude candidates below this threshold. Other institutions regard the BMAT as informative, considering the full context of wider academic achievements to determine which candidates to interview. Candidates applying for graduate medicine may be exempt, under certain circumstances, from having to sit the BMAT.

###Content Summary

The BMAT assessment itself is comprised of 3 sections; the first two are a combination of short answer and multiple-choice questions.

* Section 1 – Aptitude and Skills
    Comprehension, problem solving and the ability to process data are examined. Candidates must answer 35 questions in 1 hour. Questions are largely multiple-choice.
* Section 2 – Scientific Knowledge and Application
    This section examines candidates' science and maths skills. Candidates complete 27 questions in 30 minutes. Questions are largely multiple-choice.
* Section 3 – Writing Task
    Candidates write an essay, to address 1 specific question, from a choice of 3 questions. Analytical skills, communication, the ability to argue coherently and communication skills are examined. The ability to argue in a concise and condensed way is also key; candidates have only 1 side of paper to write their essays. Candidates have 30 minutes to complete their essays.

###Dates

The test date is typically early November. Certificates confirming results are normally circulated to candidates in late November.

The BMAT exam is held at assessment centres across the country, usually at a candidate's respective school or college, or at an assessment centre.
