The UKCAT’s use is expected to grow over the coming years in the United Kingdom.</p><p>UKCAT is a pragmatic test, focusing on assessing candidates’ respective intellects as well as their attitudes and values (in order to determine professional behaviour and suitability for their respective professions). The time allowed in total is 2 hours.</p><p>Revising for the test is difficult since it is designed to probe innate skills, including mathematical ability, comprehension, reading and writing, values and social attitudes. Genuine answers are required; indeed, the test cross-checks whether candidates’ answers are genuine.</p><p>There are no specific past papers; specimen questions are however available on the <a href="http://www.ukcat.ac.uk/pages/details.aspx?page=preparationOverview" title="UKCAT Specimen Questions">UKCAT website</a>.
