It is the successor to the former Oxford OMAT and Cambridge MVAT assessments. Over the last 4 years in particular, the use of the BMAT has expanded significantly; this is expected to continue.</p><p>There are 3 sections to the BMAT. Section 1 and 2 are marked out of 9, whereas section 3 is marked out of 15. Results of the BMAT are weighted so that scores form a normal distribution curve.</p><p>The use of the BMAT varies from institution to institution. Certain institutions require a pre-determined score (typically over 19) to invite candidates to interview and exclude candidates below this threshold. Other institutions regard the BMAT as informative, considering the full context of wider academic achievements to determine which candidates to interview. Candidates applying for graduate medicine may be exempt, under certain circumstances, from having to sit the BMAT.</p><h3>Content Summary</h3><p>The BMAT assessment itself is comprised of 3 sections; the first two are a combination of short answer and multiple-choice questions.</p><ul><li>Section 1 – Aptitude and Skills Comprehension, problem solving and the ability to process data are examined. Candidates must answer 35 questions in 1 hour. Questions are largely multiple-choice.</li><li>Section 2 – Scientific Knowledge and Application This section examines candidates&#39; science and maths skills. Candidates complete 27 questions in 30 minutes. Questions are largely multiple-choice.</li><li>Section 3 – Writing Task Candidates write an essay, to address 1 specific question, from a choice of 3 questions. Analytical skills, communication, the ability to argue coherently and communication skills are examined. The ability to argue in a concise and condensed way is also key; candidates have only 1 side of paper to write their essays. Candidates have 30 minutes to complete their essays.</li></ul><h3>Dates</h3><p>The test date is typically early November. Certificates confirming results are normally circulated to candidates in late November.</p><h3>Venues</h3><p>The BMAT exam is held at assessment centres across the country, usually at a candidate&#39;s respective school or college, or at an assessment centre.</p><h3>Universities and Courses</h3><p>The BMAT is currently used at the following institutions, for the following courses:</p><ul><li><p>University of Cambridge (C05);</p><ul><li>Medicine (A100);</li><li>Veterinary Medicine (D100); and</li><li>Graduate Course in Medicine (A101).</li></ul></li><li><p>University of Oxford Medical School (O33);</p><ul><li>Medicine (A100); and</li><li>Physiological Sciences (B100).</li></ul></li><li><p>Imperial College London (I50);</p><ul><li>Medicine (A100);</li><li>Pharmacology and Translational Medical Science (BB29);</li><li>Pharmacology and Translational Medical Science with a Year in Industry (BB2X);</li><li>Biomedical Science (3 year course) (B900); and</li><li>Biomedical Science (4 year course) (B901).</li><li>Royal Veterinary College (R84); and</li><li>Veterinary Medicine (D100); and</li><li>Combined Degree Programme (D101).</li></ul></li><li><p>University College London.</p><ul><li>Medicine (A100).</li></ul></li></ul></article></div></section><script src=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/_bower_components/jquery/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script><script src=/js/script.d16b.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
