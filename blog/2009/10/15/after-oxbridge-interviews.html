This is an opportunity to further scrutinise applications until applicants are re-interviewed or offered a place without re-interview.</p><p>Admissions Tutors use the Pool to look at applicants from other Colleges before confirming all their offers. A small number receive offers from the Colleges that interviewed them in December. If a candidate is pooled, it is advisable to wait and not contact the College.</p><p>For re-interviews, Colleges make contact in early January (by telephone and/or e-mail) and request applicants to return to Cambridge for second round interviews. Between 5-10 January, some offers are made to pooled applicants without further interview , Between 8-10 January most pooled interviews are held in Cambridge. Between 8-31 January, pooled applicants who are not called for further interview hear about the final outcome of their Cambridge application from their original College. Decisions based on re-interviews are communicated to candidates typically between 12-31 January.</p><p>In 2008, 29 Colleges pooled applicants. There were 3,174 pooled applicants in total. Of these, 794 were made offers (285 following a Pool interview - 548 pooled applicants were re-interviewed in total). Some 93 pooled applicants received offers from the College that pooled them.</p><h3>Oxford</h3><p>In Oxford, in 2008, out of the 12,623 applicants, 2,443 students were accepted by their first choice college and some 727 applicants were accepted by another college. There is a significant reshuffle over the interviewing period, though how it's done is less clear than in Cambridge.</p><p>For Oxford and Cambridge, it is important to try to research the College and potential tutors who will re-interview you. Sucedo can provide a range of services to assist you with coaching on this front.</p><h3>Acceptance and Terms of Offer</h3><p>Applicants reply within the UCAS requirements and deadlines. If applicants do not meet the conditions of offer, it is possible that they will still be offered a place - either at the original College or at another College, as a result of a small 'summer Pool'.</p></article></div></section><script src=//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/_bower_components/jquery/jquery.min.js"><\/script>')</script><script src=/js/script.d16b.js></script><!-- Google Analytics: change UA-XXXXX-X to be your site's ID. --><script>(function(b,o,i,l,e,r){b.GoogleAnalyticsObject=l;b[l]||(b[l]=
